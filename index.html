<h2>Heading Sizes: H1-H6</h2>
<p>Heading sizes 1-6 start from big to small. The h1 element usually is the most important, and gradually sizes down to h6. See the examples down below for the formatting.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

  <h3>Heading 3</h3>

<h2>Images, src, href and the importance of anchor &lt;a&gt; elements</h2>
<p>The image element &lt;img&gt; is a form of void element, so no closing tag is needed. Using &lt;img&gt;, you can attach pictures right to the website. The source attribute (ex: img src, source src, href src, audio src, video src, etc) links to a specific file, webpage, or media source. You can tell what type of &lt;src&gt; will be used based on the element name that preceeds it.</p>
<p>Anchor elements &lt;a&gt; allow you to link to another webpage. href means hypertext reference, and this attribute guides to a specific hyperlink location. You can also include text between the opening and closing tags to write your own text, which will give the user an idea of where the text will lead to. Additionally, more written text can be written before and after the anchor element!</p>

<div id="main heading"></div>
<!--the id attributes allows you to set styles to an id unique to the whole document.-->
<div class="box red_box"></div>
<div class="box blue_box"></div>
<!-- the class attribute allows you to set styles to many elements, such as alterations from Javascript or CSS.-->
<h2>HTML Entities - How the heck do you type &lt; and &gt; in HTML?</h2>
<p>When coding in html, &lt; and &gt; will not show up on a webpage unless HTML entities are used. This is a named character reference. In fact, if you look at the html file of this document, you will see many elements and notes that are not visible on the webpage. Named references start with an ampersand sign and end with a semicolon. By using a named character reference, the HTML reader will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can use &#60; or &#x3C; which are examples of using the decimal numeric and hexadecimal numeric references, respectivly.</p>
<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
<!--the script element is used to embed executable code. Also commonly used to execute javascript in a separate file. Use the src attribute to link.-->
<h1 id="UniqueHeader">What's the difference: id vs. class?</h1>
<h2>id</h2>
<p>The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id. The id attribute CANNOT use spaces, unlike the class attribute.</p>
<p>The id attribute was used for the blue banner header above.</p>
<h2>class</h2>
<p>In contrast to the id attribute, the class attribute value does not need to be unique to the page and can contain spaces. See the example below:</p>
<div class="city">
  <h3>London</h3>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>
<div class="city">
  <h3>Paris</h3>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>
<div class="city">
  <h3>Tokyo</h3>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>
<h2>script</h2>
<p>The script element is used to embed executable code. Typically used for Javascript to create more dynamic and interactive webpages. Javascript code should be written in a separate file for best practice, but it can be executed in HTML file.</p>
<script>
  // alert("Welcome to my first handmade HTML website!");
  <!--If you would like to enable this alert, remove the //-->
</script>
<h2>meta content</h2>
  <p>When you use og: protocol (open graph) in your meta data, this will make your website look more appealing when shared across multiple social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, X, etc). Some social media platforms have unique tags for card formatting on their website, so check out the developer pages on the individual platforms. See how open graph data looks when well-utilized below:</p>

  <h2>audio and video</h2>
  <p>Audio and video elements work similarly and are fairly simple to code. To add an audio player, use the controls attribute. To loop music, use the loop attribute. To start music muted, use the muted attribute (this on/off nature of muted state is a good exanple of a boolean attribute).
  <p>Depending on browsers, some media players won't be supported, so it's a good idea to add a few sourse elements for browsers to pick from in case the first or second optiob fails. Code this as:
  <p>&lt;source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg"</p>
  <p>&lt;source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav"</p>
  <p>&lt;source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"</p></p>
  <audio src="assets/Zane Little - Ill-Fated Fantasy.mp3"
  controls
  muted
  loop
></audio>
<p>For video elements, you code the same way as an audio element: &lt;audio src=""&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; but replace audio with video. The loop, controls and muted attributes all apply to video as well. If you wanted to display an image while the video is downloading, you can use the poster attribute.</p>
